Scripts used to estimate tree N fixation from FIA

Two methods were used: (1) Estimate from single time-point N-fixer abundances, and (2) estimate from N required to fulfil growth observed between two time points.

Data mergning and cleaning scripts:

Method one (single time point abundances) scripts:

Method two (N required for growth) scripts:

Visualization scripts:
